                    <li><b>June 16th, 2021:</b> In case you haven't seen it yet, Assignment 4 is live on the <a class="assignment-color" href="assignments.html">assignments page.</a> It is due on Saturday, June 19th 8:00 PM PT.</li>
                    <li><b>June 12th, 2021:</b> The Week 4 exam has been released on the <a href="exams.html" class="exam-color">exams page</a>. The code for the exam is <b>[omitted]</b>.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>June 11th, 2021:</b> Instead of producing a video for the Week 4 lesson for asynchronous viewing, I will be pushing it back to this Sunday and compressing two weeks into one week later in the class. Do not fear that the compressed week will feel too fast; the concepts of those weeks can be learned quickly and only need to be consolidated over time.<br><br>Assignment 3 grades will be released soon through Discord PM. The Week 4 exam will be taken using the Green Pamphlet software, and the file for the exam will be made available on the exams tab tomorrow at 8:00 PM PT.
