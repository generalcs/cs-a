                <h1>Assignments</h1>
                <p>For many of you, these assignments are your first step into the world of development. Starting your programming journey is an incredible experience; you begin to realize the power and applications that coding has. Programming is a tool for you to express your ideas and create anything in your wildest imagination. Keep that in mind as you progress through CS-A and the assignments listed below.</p>
                <p>For those who are not new to programming or Java, these assignments mark the beginning of your journey into deeper understanding and higher proficiency with Java. Take this opportunity to really flesh out your skills with an OOP language and fix poor coding habits.</p>

                <h2>Structure</h2>
                <p>To help you consolidate the Java topics of the week, assignments are structured to test four areas of understanding:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your comprehension of the concepts taught in class (<span class="assignment-color">Written Questions - Required</span>)</li>
                    <li>Your ability to execute your comprehension in a programming environment (<span class="assignment-color">Core Assignment - Required</span>)</li>
                    <li>Your mastery of the topics in applying it to a different, complex setting (<span class="assignment-color">Assignment Extension - Optional</span>)</li>
                    <li>Your discipline in reviewing and practicing the concepts throughout the week (<span class="assignment-color">Additional Practice - Optional</span>)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Although the last two sections are not required, they will help in developing a solid foundation for future assignments and topics. The assignments are not intentionally created in a way such that the previous assignments are required to complete the next; that is the result of the later assignments being more complex systems and needing all these core concepts anyway.</p>
                <h2>Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="exam-color">Take breaks between assignment milestones.</span> Each core assignment section is split up into sequential milestones so that you can take a break in between each chunk. While many programmers have gone without sleep or coded for hours on end before, it's neither healthy or productive to do so, and the quality of your code quickly declines. Taking a break before the start of each milestone will lead to coding better and happier.</li>
                    <li><span class="exam-color">Test as you go.</span> Testing can feel tedious and boring at times, but it is the key to having bug-free code and reducing the amount of work you must do for each assignment. The longer you leave a bug in your code, the longer it will take for you to find it and fix it. Testing at the end of each milestone will allow you to localize where a bug could be, and also have the satisfaction of completing the assignment quickly. Spending hours trying to fix your code and finding out that it was a small bug you missed because you didn't test earlier is the worst feeling.</li>
                    <li><span class="exam-color">Ask questions.</span> Clarifying parts of the assignment you don't understand or are unsure about will ensure that you are doing the homework correctly. As with exams, you do not want to answer a question that is not being asked. Assignments are designed to test your understanding of particular concepts in well-defined areas. While accidentally solving something different <i>sometimes</i> reaps great rewards for your understanding, it usually does not provide as much benefit as sticking to the what the assignment specifies.</li>
                    <li><span class="exam-color">Experiment with your code.</span> On the other end of the spectrum, after you have done all the required parts of the assignment, experimenting with the concepts will further develop your understanding of those topics. Experimenting and having a curious mind is crucial in fostering an environment where you learn the most. Think of a twist you could apply to your current code, or create a different program that uses the concepts of the week in a different way. Remember to paste your assignment code into your submission file before experimenting with your current assignment code.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Submission and Grading</h2>
                <p>For each assignment, all your code will be compiled into one text file ready for submission. To submit an assignment, send me your completed assignment text file via Discord PM by the deadline, which will be listed on the homepage schedule for every assignment. Your graded file will be returned to you through PM with comments attached, scores for each section of the assignment, and an overall score. If you have a question about the grade you received or any of my comments, please respond to the graded assignment PM with your concerns.</p>
                <h2>Policies</h2>
                <p>Pair programming partners are not allowed on assignments, unless otherwise specified inside an assignment writeup.</p>
                <p>Cheating and plagiarism are strictly prohibited and will result in a 0 on any assignment and possible expulsion from the course, though it makes no sense to have any temptation to cheat because this class is purely for your own edification.</p>
                <p>You may refer to online forums such as Stack Overflow to get conceptual understanding or specific library knowledge, but as always, direct copying, paraphrasing, or sharing of code is prohibited and subject to the same consequences mentioned above.</p>
                <p>You may ask questions in the #assignment-help channel on Discord or privately PM me; however, posting code in a public channel is not allowed. You may not share or take intellectual property to or from any other student, which non-exhaustively includes code, debugging strategies, or testing strategies. The #assignment-help channel is designated for clarifying questions and questions about concepts related to the assignments, not for questions and answers about the concepts in the assignment <i>and</i> also in the context of the assignment. This applies not only to the #assignment-help channel, but anywhere you may happen to talk about the assignments.</p>
