                <h2>Structure</h2>
                <p>To help you consolidate the Java topics of the week, assignments are structured to test four areas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understanding (<b>Written Questions - Required</b>)</li>
                    <li>Execution (<b>Core Assignment - Required</b>)</li>
                    <li>Application (<b>Assignment Extension - Optional</b>)</li>
                    <li>Review (<b>Additional Practice - Optional</b>)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Although the last two sections are not required, they develop a solid foundation for future assignments and topics.</p>
                <h2>Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Take breaks between assignment milestones.</b> Each core assignment is split into milestones so that you can take a break between each part. Taking breaks maximizes your productivity while maintaining your code quality.</li>
                    <li><b>Test as you go.</b> Testing is the key to having bug-free code without spending a long time debugging. The longer you leave a bug in your code, the longer it will take for you to find it and fix it. Testing at the end of each milestone will allow you to localize where a bug is.</li>
                    <li><b>Ask questions.</b> Clarifying parts of the assignment you don't understand or are unsure about will ensure that you are doing the homework correctly.</li>
                    <li><b>Experiment with your code.</b> Experimenting with concepts will further develop your understanding of those concepts. Think of a twist you could apply to your current code, or create a different program that uses the concepts in a different way. Remember to paste your assignment code into your submission file before experimenting with your current assignment code.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Submission and Grading</h2>
                <p>For each assignment, please place all your code into one text file ready for submission. To submit, send me your completed assignment text file via Discord PM by the deadline, which will be listed on the homepage schedule for every assignment. Your graded file will be returned to you through PM with comments, subscores, and an overall score attached. If you have a question about the grade you received or about any of my comments, please respond to the graded assignment PM with your concerns.</p>
                <h2>Policies</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pair programming partners are not allowed on assignments, unless otherwise specified in an assignment writeup.</li>
                    <li>Cheating and plagiarism are strictly prohibited and will result in expulsion from the course.</li>
                    <li>You may refer to online forums such as Stack Overflow to get conceptual understanding or specific library knowledge, but direct copying, sharing, and paraphrasing is not allowed.</li>
                    <li>Please do not post code, debugging, or testing strategies in a public channel on the Discord. However, you may ask general questions in the #assignment-help channel.</li>
                </ul>
